## Instructions

I want to generate new test items for moodle. In directory E/exams, there is dataset with student grades and one moodle test.
I want to crete artificial datasets and simulate them using {{faux}} and {{simdag}}


details about simdag are here https://github.com/RobinDenz1/simDAG

First, generate several artificial datasets. I want to have diverse set of datasets and in each dataset, there should be several ordinal, several nominal and several numeric variables. For each dataset, create a codebook with description of variables. 
When I approve the datasets and codebooks, we can proceed to simulate them using simdag/faux. It would be nic if some variables would be causally linked, ideally to show some backdoors etc. For each dataset, I want at least 20 questions from these areas:
- descriptive statistics
- data visualization
- correlation analysis
- lienear regression
- t-test
- ANOVA
- chi-square test

Students will be performing analysis in Jamovi. I need format suitable for moodle import (and not only multiple choice, but also some numeric input). Moodle part and Codebook should be in Czech, datasets could be in English.
